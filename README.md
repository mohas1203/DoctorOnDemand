# DoctorOnDemand
Doctor on demand is a native android application that is created to flatten the curve of the popular virus COVID-19. Doctor on demand uses Rest API that is fetching live data about the number of cases, deaths and resolved cases in the world. It also has sections to contact a doctor and information on how to protect yourself from COVID-19. This information is directly taken from CDC. The UI of the application was designed with Adobe XD.
